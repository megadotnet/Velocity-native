## Intro
           
           Spring Boot 3 native applications require compile time definitions of which reflection data needs to be available at runtime. 
       We could provide this info for its own classes by adding a RuntimeHintsRegistrar.



## Spring Boot 3: Unleashing Native Power with GraalVM

Spring Boot 3 brings exciting advancements, and one of the most notable is its seamless integration with GraalVM native image support. This powerful combination enables you to create self-contained executables of your Spring Boot applications, offering significant benefits like:

* **Faster startup times:** Native images eliminate the need for a full JVM, resulting in dramatically faster application launches.
* **Reduced memory footprint:** Native executables only contain the code your application needs, leading to lower memory consumption and improved resource efficiency.
* **Improved portability:** Native images can run on various platforms without requiring a specific Java environment, simplifying deployment and distribution.

This article guides you through leveraging Spring Boot 3's native capabilities with GraalVM:

**Prerequisites:**

* **Java 17 or later:** Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17 for native image generation.
* **GraalVM:** Download and install GraalVM from [https://www.graalvm.org/](https://www.graalvm.org/).
* **Spring Boot 3 application:** Ensure you have a Spring Boot 3 project set up.

**Steps:**

1. **Add GraalVM plugin:**

   In your project's build configuration (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle), add the GraalVM native plugin:

   ```xml
   <plugin>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-native</artifactId>
       <version>3.0.x</version>
   </plugin>
   ```

2. **Build the native image:**

   Use the following command to build a native image of your application:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew nativeImage  # For Gradle
   mvn spring-boot:build-image  # For Maven
   ```

   This generates a native executable named after your application's main class (e.g., `my-app`).

3. **Run the native image:**

   Execute the generated native image directly:

   ```bash
   ./my-app
   ```

**Additional considerations:**

* **Resource handling:** Native images require explicit inclusion of required resources during build time. Refer to the Spring Boot documentation for details on managing resources in native images.
* **Reflection and dynamic code:** Native images might have limitations with reflection and dynamic code loading. Ensure your application uses these features sparingly or consider alternative approaches.

**Exploring further:**

* Spring Boot documentation on GraalVM native image support: [https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html)
* GraalVM documentation: [https://www.graalvm.org/](https://www.graalvm.org/)

By embracing Spring Boot 3's native capabilities, you can significantly enhance your application's performance, portability, and resource efficiency. With GraalVM's support, you can create self-contained executables that streamline deployment and operation, empowering your applications to thrive in diverse environments.
